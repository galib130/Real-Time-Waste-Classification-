# Real Time Waste classification


In this project I trained a vgg16  model on a dataset which consists of 34 classes of different types of waste objects.


I converted the model into tf lite model and integrated it with the Flutter app


Classification process takes place in real time using Camera controller to take pictures and provide the top most classification result in real time
